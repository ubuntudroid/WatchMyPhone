/**
 * The CEFXController takes care of the session handling and the server
 * connection. When a document is opened, the CEFXController checks, if the
 * client is already connected to a session with the server. If no session
 * exists, the controller connects the client to the server and opens a new
 * session. A document that is opened for the first time in a collaborative
 * editing session, is opened locally by the CEFXController and then send to the
 * server. The server then stores this document. The next time the document is
 * opened, the CEFXController loads it from the server instead of the local file
 * system. The CEFXController is created in the initialisation phase of the DA
 * and loads all plug-ins - as configured in the CEFX configuration file - and
 * initialises them. This is done with the help of the ExtensionRegistry. The
 * controller has a connection to every component of the system. It is
 * responsible for delegating the execution of operations to the concurrency
 * controller and allows retrieval of a reference to each of the other framework
 * components. The CEFXController implements the OperationExecutor interface and
 * thus acts, from the perspective of the concurrency controller, as a client.
